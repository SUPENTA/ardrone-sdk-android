# Parrot AR Drone SDK v2.0.1 - ENHANCED
Parrot's official AR.Drone SDK 2.0.1, now up-to-date to work with Android Studio.

## Why this repo?

Parrot has dropped support for its ARDrone 2.0 (kind of).
The [Play Store app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parrot.freeflight&hl=en) hasn't been updated since 2013.
There was an official SDK, but it is no longer available online on the [official developer page](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/developer-zone/).

Still it can be found (version 2.0.1 [here](http://forum.developer.parrot.com/t/whats-the-state-of-the-sdk-support-for-ar-drone-2-0-ardrone-sdk-2-0-1-tar-gz/314) for instance).
It contains the source files for the SDK and sample apps on various platforms.

Also, in the Android world, things have changed a lot since 2013.
Android Studio and Gradle have replaced the old Eclipse and Ant build system.
The Parrot SDK was based on this deprecated build system and we need an updated sample app.

**This repository aims at making the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 SDK widely available again.
It is primarily for Android developers.
It contains the source files for the SDK, and the Parrot FreeFlight sample app as an Android Studio project.**


Feel free to share it around!
